# CSET-Georgetown-Cybersecurity-Publication

Please refer to the PDF report for the full publication I wrote with the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. It can also be viewed here: https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/u-s-high-school-cybersecurity-competitions/

This report was reviewed by the office of Senator Joe Manchin (Democrat-West Virginia) alongside a few other congressional and defense agency offices. It is directed for policymaker and national defense audiences and aims to identify which factors are influential in cultivating cybersecurity interest and talent from the high school level.
